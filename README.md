# terraform_day08
Full Example from Scratch
Hereâ€™s a complete example from scratch:

Create main.tf

hcl
Copy code
provider "aws" {
  region = "ap-south-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "deepak" {
  # Configuration will be generated after import
}
Initialize Terraform


terraform init
Import the EC2 Instance


terraform import aws_instance.deepak i-07bc6bf081df643d2
Run Plan with Configuration Generation


terraform plan -generate-config-out=generated_resource.tf
If the Issue Persists
If the issue still persists, consider the following steps:

Check for Typos: Ensure there are no typos or additional spaces in the command.
Verify the Configuration: Double-check the main.tf file for correctness.
Check for Environment Issues: Ensure there are no environmental issues or conflicting settings.
Alternative Approach
If you continue to encounter issues with the -generate-config-out flag, manually updating the configuration file might be a reliable workaround. Use the terraform show command to display the current state and update your main.tf accordingly.

Summary
Ensure the correct command syntax without extra arguments.
Verify you are using a supported Terraform version.
Initialize the directory and run the import command correctly.
Troubleshoot with the -chdir flag if necessary.
Manually update the configuration file as a workaround.
Following these steps should help you successfully use the -generate-config-out flag without encountering the "Too many command line arguments" error.
